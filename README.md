# Gatsby Starter StripeMart

Like a supermarket but for Stripe.

This is a _basic_ and _minimalist_ store built with Gatsby, Stripe, Use-Shopping-Cart, and Netlify. It is intended for a merchant who sells in low volumes at a casual scale.

The three main features are:

- A shopping cart and checkout flow with Stripe and Use-Shopping-Cart
- Inventory management via Netlify serverless functions
- Basic support for shipping options in the checkout flow

The benefit of using this set of technologies is that there are no ongoing monthly costs - you only pay the [Stripe transaction fees](https://stripe.com/pricing) when you actually sell something. This means if that you have a seasonal business or periods inactivity then you don't incur any expenses.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up!

A few words of caution.

- If you have an active and ongoing business please use [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) or [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/). They are _great_ products and are way better for most people, most of the time.
- This starter will never reach v1.0, it is intended as a barebones starter that you can fork and make your own! I will likely never add more features than those listed above because there are better products for more complete e-commerce experiences.
